Hadoop Winutils

For Window machine:

If you donâ€™t have Hadoop,
you need to create Hadoop folder and also create Bin folder in it and then copy and paste winutils.exe file in it.

download winutils file from 
https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils or better:
https://github.com/kontext-tech/winutils

and paste into hadoop\bin folder and set environment variable for c:\hadoop\bin;

create folder c:\tmp\hive

give the full permission to this folder \tmp\hive like this: 

cd "C:\hadoop\bin"
then 
winutils.exe chmod 777 /tmp/hive

may need:

copy hadoop.dll from "C:\hadoop\bin" and
paste hadoop.dll into C:/Windows/System32
