1)To go to root use "cd /" command
$ cd /
and then type "pwd" to check / (if your in root)

2)To go to home use cd or cd ~
$ cd 
and then type "pwd" to check /home/wterry (if your in HOME)

Important Commands:

remember: use mkdir --help to see usage and arguments, --help works with any command not just mkdir
also ctrl+l clears console and "exit" exits console

1)mkdir

The mkdir command in Linux/Unix allows users to create or make new directories. mkdir stands for “make directory.”

mkdir dir1
mkdir {test1,test2,test3}
mkdir –p Linux/dirtest1/dirtest2

2)rmdir and rm

The command-line utility for deleting empty directories. It is useful when you want to delete a directory only if it is empty, without needing to check whether the directory is empty or not.

rmdir dir1  ->only empty dir
rm -r dir1   ->dir with contents
rm -r dir1 dir2 dir3 ->all listed directory will be deleted

try:
rm -r Linux

this removes all of subdirectories created above

3) cp 

a) Two file names : If the command contains two file names, then it copy the contents of 1st file to the 2nd file. If the 2nd file doesn’t exist, then first it creates one and content is copied to it. But if it existed then it is simply overwritten without any warning. So be careful when you choose destination file name.

cp Src_file Dest_file

4) cd

Change directory

cd -> defaults to value of HOME shell variable
cd / -> go to root
cd .. -> '..' is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component

5) ls 

for listing the data in the folders

ls -> list down
ls -t -> sort by modification time
ls -1 -> Display One File Per Line 
ls -l -> Display All Information About Files/Directories 
ls -lt -> Order Files Based on Last Modified Time
ls -ltr-> Order Files Based on Last Modified Time (In Reverse Order)


6) cat

Cat(concatenate) command is very frequently used in Linux. It reads data from the file and gives their content as output. It helps us to create, view, concatenate files. So let us see some frequently used cat commands. 

$cat filename -> To view a single file 

$cat file1 file2 -> To view multiple files 

$ cat >newfile -> Will create a file named newfile


7)grep

Grep is a Linux / Unix command-line tool used to search for a string of characters in a specified file. The text search pattern is called a regular expression. When it finds a match, it prints the line with the result. The grep command is handy when searching through large log files.

a)$ grep "literal_string" filename.

b)$ grep "this" demo_file

c)$ history | grep dnf


8)echo

echo command in linux is used to display line of text/string that are passed as an argument . This is a built in command that is mostly used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a file.

echo -e "Geeks \bfor \bGeeks"

echo -e "Geeks \cfor Geeks"

echo -e "Geeks \nfor \nGeeks"

echo -e "Geeks \tfor \tGeeks"

echo -e "Geeks \rfor Geeks"

echo -e "Geeks \vfor \vGeeks
