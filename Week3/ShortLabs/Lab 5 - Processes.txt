# top -> display all running processes live

> q -> to quit this view

# lscpu -> all information about the CPU (note the architecture, Byte Order, Hypervisor)
!! Investigate 

# chrt -m -> List types of priorites in this system plus the range numbers

# mkdir ~/Empty -> Create an empty directory

-> Create an infinite process (We are ls an empty directory, we won't fill out the drive if we forget to kill this process)
-> An infinite process, is also known as Daemon
# while : ; do ls ~/Empty ; done > ls.txt &

# top -> track the Daemon, the owner should be yourself, and the process is *bash* [get the ID]

# chrt -r -p 51 PID -> Use the process ID gathered before, changing priority type to round Robin with 51
-> Look how this slows down our shell (do arrow keys up), since the process is almost always running now.
-> This is because the OS want's to get rid of this process first since is longer

# top -> Always at the top now, keep an eye con CPU usage

# chrt -o -p 0 PID -> Bring him back to normal

# kill -9 PID -> Forcefully kill this process

# crontab -l -> Should be empty, let's automate a simple process

# crontab -e -> Brings vim in

> * * * * * echo Welcome to the Cron >> ~/crontab.txt

--> Every minute now, we will add a new line to crontab.txt, keep an eye on your home directory until the file appears.
--> When you learn scripting, this could be a script that performs a complex process and you could do it in any schedule, following the cron expressions.
