*****PARTITIONS*****

# df -> Filesystem disk space usage, there is one better than this

# lsblk -> double check the main disk, should be sda

# ls /dev -> All of the devices are here with their id

# sudo fdisk /dev/sda -> Open the application, it will prompt you to another shell

> m -> for help

> p -> print state of partition table

> v -> print unallocated space, we need this space to create new partitions.

> n -> create a new partition

> p -> choose the primary partition type

> ENTER twice times -> Leave defaults for partition number and starting block

> +250M -> 250MiB partition ~ 262MB

> p -> Take a look at the partition table now. We have sda3 now.

> n -> create another partition

> p -> Automatically selected partition 4 now

> ENTER twice -> default for starting block and ending block, using rest of unallocated space -> 257MiB

> p -> Check our final state

> w -> Write the new partition table changes to the disk

!WARNING!, we need to shutdown the machine in order to see the changes. Sometimes this works right away.

# lsblk -> It's true, partitions are not here

# shutdown -h now

-> After reboot

# lsblk -> Check your new state

*****RAID 0*****

# sudo mdadm -E /dev/sda[3-4] -> Check that there is no MD blocks on the paritions we will RAID

# sudo mdadm -C /dev/md0 -l raid0 -n 2 /dev/sda[3-4] -> Array name, Level, Number of drives, Drives

# lsblk -> Check your partitions now, we have md0 around

# sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0 -> Check RAID details

-> We have our RAID 0 running now, these steps can be done without the RAID on the partitions we created, individually
-> However, we will format our new ARRAY with an ext4 filesystem

# sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0 -> Format our new array with ext4

# sudo mount /dev/md0 /media/raid -> Mount our new filesystem as a drive [sudo umount /media/raid removes the filesystem]

# cd /media/raid -> You are now in the raid

# sudo echo Welcome to the RAID >> raid.txt -> You just wrote a file into two drives.

- How to create a Logical Volume group like that one that displays with lsblk **lvm**, this avoids mounting volumes.
