# free -> Display current memory usage, simple way

# free -m -> In MB

# free -h -> Human readable

# watch -n 0.1 free -> Execute free every 0.1 seconds, you leverage watch to monitor anything

# vmstat -> Displays not only memory information, but CPU, I/O and more (check your notes, remember some of what this info means)

***CREATE A SWAP AREA***

# sudo fallocate -l 1G /revature_swap -> Allocate 1GB to revature_swap file (this is just a file for now that is occupying space)

# du -h /revature_swap -> Make sure is 1G (It's 1GiB which is 1.1GB)

# sudo chmod 600 /revature_swap -> Make this file secure, it will complain when we turn it on if we don't

# sudo mkswap /revature_swap -> Make this allocated a file a swap

# free -h-> check your swap space (remember it, should be 8G depending on your setup)

# sudo swapon /revature_swap -> Turn this swap area on

# free -h -> you have one more gig now

# sudo swapoff /revature_swap -> Turn off the swap area

# free -h -> back to your main size

-> Look at the content of this file
-> It has the swap area we installed withn Red Hat
-> To make the new on permanent, you would have to add (with vim and saving it): /revature_swap swap swap sw 0 0
-> Without this added here, we have to swapon everytime we reboot.
