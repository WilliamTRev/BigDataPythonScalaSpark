Spark Installation:

For Window machine:

Download spark-2.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz (spark-3.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz) from this site https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html

Unzip and Paste your spark folder in C:\ drive and set environment variable.

If you donâ€™t have Hadoop,
you need to create Hadoop folder and also create Bin folder in it and then copy and paste winutils.exe file in it.

download winutils file from 
https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils or better:
https://github.com/kontext-tech/winutils

and paste winutils selected hadoop version into hadoop\bin folder and set environment variable for c:\hadoop\bin;

do this:

C:\Windows\system32>C:\hadoop\bin\winutils.exe chmod 777 /tmp/hive

open command prompt first run C:\hadoop\bin> winutils.exe  and then navigate to C:\spark\bin>

run spark-shell


-------------
Did you set your environment variables correctly? SPARK_HOME, HADOOP_HOME as your spark installation directory and add $SPARK_HOME\bin to PATH
